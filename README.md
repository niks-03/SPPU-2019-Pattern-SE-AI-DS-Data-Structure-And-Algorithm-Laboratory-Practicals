Second Year Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Practical for Data Structures and Algorithm Laboratory

Practical_1 : Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up clientâ€˜s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers

Practical_2 : Create ADT that implements the "set" concept and perform following operations:
a.	Add (new Element) -Place a value into the set,
b.	Remove (element) Remove the value
c.	Contains (element) Return true if element is in collection,
d.	Size () Return number of values in collection Iterator () Return an iterator used to loop over collection,
e.	Intersection of two sets,
f.	Union of two sets,
g.	Difference between two sets,
h.	Subset

Practical_3 : Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree - i. Insert new node, ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, iii. Minimum data value found in the tree, iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node, v. Search a value 

Practical_4 : A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for implementation. 

Practical_5 :  Construct an expression tree from the given prefix expression eg. +--a*bc/def and
traverse it using post order traversal (non recursive) and then delete the entire tree. 

Practical_6 : There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight take to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Check whether the graph is connected or not. Justify the storage representation used.

Practical_7 : Consider a scenario for Hospital to cater services to different kinds of patients as Serious (top priority), b) non-serious (medium priority), c) General Checkup (Least priority). Implement the priority queue to cater services to the patients.

Practical_8 : Department  maintains  a  student  information.  The  file  contains  roll  number,  name, division  and  address.  Allow  user  to  add,  delete  information  of  student.  Display information  of  particular  employee.  If  record  of  student  does  not  exist  an  appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential file to main the data.
